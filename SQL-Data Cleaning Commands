1.Introduction

This portfolio uses examples tables customers, orders, employees, and products to show 
how to use SQL for data cleansing activities. Sample queries that demonstrate typical 
data cleansing procedures are included in every section.

2.Common Data Cleaning Commands

Removinng Duplicates

The 'DISTINCT' keyword is used to remove duplicate rows from the result set.

Example:

SELECT DISTINCT Email
FROM Customers;

You might need to use a ROW_NUMBER function or a DELETE statement with a subquery in 
order to eliminate duplicates from a table.

Example:

DELETE FROM customers
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(customer_id)
    FROM customers
    GROUP BY email
);

3.UPDATE
Use the UPDATE statement in a table to replace NULL values.

Example:

UPDATE customers
SET email = 'days312@example.com'
WHERE email IS NULL;

4.Formatting Data

The case of string data can be changed using the 'UPPER', 'LOWER', and INITCAP methods.

Example:

SELECT UPPER(first_name) AS first_name_upper,
       LOWER(last_name) AS last_name_lower
FROM customers;

5.Removing Unwanted Characters

To replace instances of a given substring, use the 'REPLACE' function.

Example:

SELECT REPLACE(phone, '-', '') AS phone
FROM customers;

6.Data Type Conversion

A value can be converted between different data types using the CAST function. 

*This function changes the order_date column to a standard DATE data type, which
 normally only contains the year, month, and day components and excludes time. The
 order_date column may have been in another format, such as DATETIME, VARCHAR, or
 another format.

Example:

SELECT CAST(order_date AS DATE) AS order_date
FROM orders;

7.Splitting Columns

String functions such as 'SUBSTRING' and 'POSITION' can be used to split a column into numerous columns.

Example:

SELECT SUBSTRING(full_name FROM 1 FOR POSITION(' ' IN full_name) - 1) AS first_name,
       SUBSTRING(full_name FROM POSITION(' ' IN full_name) + 1) AS last_name
FROM employees;

8.Trimming Spaces

To eliminate spaces from strings, using the TRIM, LTRIM, and RTRIM functions.

Example:

SELECT TRIM(both ' ' from first_name) AS first_name_trimmed
FROM customers;

9.Renaming Columns

To rename columns, use the ALTER TABLE statement.

Example:

ALTER TABLE customers
RENAME COLUMN email TO email_address;
